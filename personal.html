			<p>One of my favorite movies I have ever seen is Leningrad Cowboys Go America. I can not describe what about it is so appealing to me, but from start to finish, I was hooked and fully invested in the Leningrad Cowboys's journey. The film follows a polka band from Siberia and their efforts to perform for a birthday party for a family in Mexico. Along the way, there are many twists and turns, and though the music may change as they go along, their touching story will remain in my heart and mind forever.</p>

		<div class = "fuzz_text">
			<p>Another great film is Hot Fuzz directed by Edgar Wright. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost continue the Coronetto Trilogy with a story of buddy cops in a quiet town. There are lots of great moments and Edgar Wright does a great job tying everything together for the finale with plenty of callbacks and one-liners. His unique rapid editing style speeds the slow parts along while still telling the story and showing the audience what they need to know. The film also does a great job keeping the comedic aspects funny while still keeping the tension of a murder mystery. </p>

			<p>Next up is O Brother, Where Art Thou? This film is certainly one of my favorites, and for good reason. George Clooney, John Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson play three convicts who have broken free from their chains and hit the road in search of treasure. The dynamic between Everett (Clooney), Pete (Turturro), and Delmar(Nelson) makes for many entertaining moments. Despite only seeing this film maybe three times, I can still remember nearly every line as every actor puts forth a fantastic and memorable performance. On top of all of this, the soundtrack perfectly encapsulates the time period while slipping in and out of the world of the film as radios become travelling music. The film is loosely based off of The Odyssey, but is still distinct enough to tell a captivating story with many colorful characters along the way.</p>

		<div class = "charlie_text">
			<p>It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown! This film is a classic for me. I always loved Charlie Brown growing up and to this day, a holiday is not complete without a Charlie Brown TV Special to go with it. Standing out above all others is, of course, the Great Pumpkin. Join Charles Schulz's Peanuts characters as they celebrate the spookiest time of the year through Trick or Treating, Parties, and most importantly, waiting for the Great Pumpkin to arrive. There are also many separate scenes that don't fit into the plot as a whole, but are still in the seasonal spirit, such as Snoopy, dressed as a World War I Flying Ace, taking on the Red Baron in a deadly dogfight, and his subsequent scramble across the French countryside after being shot down. I do acknowledge that the nostalgia goggles might be on a little tight for this film, but I still believe it is an entertaining movie for all ages.</p>

		<div class = "fox_text">
			<p>Fantastic Mr. Fox, based on the book by Roald Dahl, tells the story of Mr. Fox and his family after his decision to begin his old hooby of stealing birds from the local farmers. There is a certain charm to the stop motion animals that I find hard to put into words, but it really makes the film have that signature Wes Anderson feeling. Although it may differ from the book, the film does a great job keeping in the spirit and bringing the viewer along in the action. There are also many times when things happen to almost acknowledge the stop motion aspect in a self aware way as well that keep the tone fairly comical despite what may actually be going on. Another great film for the whole family to enjoy.</p>

		<div class = "ampsycho_text">
			<p>American Psycho has been on my list for a very long time and I have to say, it was worth the wait. Although certainly not in the same family friendly category as some of the other films shown here, Christian Bale does a phenominal job in the main role. I was certianly surprised when, throughout the film, Patrick Bateman, the protagonist, outright says to those around him that he is killing people and he wants to stop only to be met with indifference or dismissal. There are also many great quotes throughout the film and though it may not have been immediately wwell recieved, it has certainly earned the cult following it has gained over the years. The film can also be interpreted in a number of ways, leaving the true question of what actually occurred in the film up to the viewer. A very entertaining film, albeit gruesome and violent.</p>

		<div class = "giant_text">
			<p>The Iron Giant is a great return to the child friendly movie theme and a good break from the blood and gore of American Psycho. The film follows Hogarth Hughes, a boy from Maine, and his experience with a collosal robot from the stars. The voice acting gives the film a big boost with great performances across the board, most notably, from Harry Connick Jr. as Dean, the junkyard artist. Though being focused on children, the film does not shy away from themes like death and gun violence, eventually ending with a bang in a climactic finale. Certainly a classic that holds up over the years.</p>

		<div class = "pilgrim_text">
			<p>Scott Pilgrim vs The World is another Edgar Wright film and another adaptation, though this time from a graphic novel. Though this has been a bit of a divisive movie among the people I have met at Michigan, it is, in my opinion, another quality piece in Edgar Wright's portfolio. The video game aspect is worked in well from page to screen, but there are a few scenes that can get a little cringe-worthy, although that's part of the fun. The cast of this film is surprisingly good, and nearly everyone went on to star in very big franchises in the future, with such names as Chris Evans and Brie Larson in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Anna Kendrick with Pitch Perfect, and Aubrey Plaza and Michael Cera in the same role in basically everything else they are in. Again, the Edgar Wright editing makes for some very entertaining scenes and Michael Cera really channels being kind of awkward and weird well. There is also a great musical aspect to this movie as Scott and friends play in the Battle of the Bands. Another odd thing about this movie that gets worse every time I see it is that Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler. It's almost the first thing they say in the movie and on every rewatch it becomes more and more clear that Scott Pilgrim is not supposed to be a good person, but Michael Cera's goofy quiet portrayal makes the viewer root for him when the point is that you really shouldn't like him. All in all, another fantastic cult film that, despite my less-than-glowing review, remains as one of my favorite films.</p>

			<p>The Incredibles rounds out the list with another hit from Brad Bird. For one reason or another, I have memorized certain scenes from this movie and can frame-for-frame recreate them almost exactly in person. This odd obsession doesn't come up often, but when it does, it never fails to get a "why did you do this" from anyone who cares to look on in confused indifference. My odd relationship with this film aside, The Incredibles opens fairly quickly by showing the problems with a society of superpowered individuals. Should a suicide jumper be saved? Should banks be robbed and reimbursed with insurance money, or is it the responsibility of these supers to save the day? And most importantly of all, who is responsible for the damages caused in the name of justice? Ultimately, The Incredibles is about family and the harm that selfish acts can cause others. The score is full of the big band sound often associated with old spy movies and it makes the action that much better when a trumpet blast punctuates a super-strength-powered punch through a wall. The film also does a great job at making sure to show that despite the powers, they are still a family through things like arguing about directions on the way to stop an evil robot and the kids picking on each other. Brad Bird himself also makes a cameo in the role of Edna Mode, the designer of the supersuits used  by the family. Altogether, The Incredibles is another family film that begins to step into the more serious side othe things while also maintaing the cartoonish violence expected of a superhero film.</p>
